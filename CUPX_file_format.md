# SeeYou CUPX file format

*Copyright © 2019, Naviter d.o.o. All Rights Reserved*



CUPX format is an extension of the cup format. It is actually a combination of two ZIP files combined in a CUPX file.

It can be created by

`copy /b pics.zip + points.zip test.cupx`

or on linux

`cat pics.zip points.zip > test.cupx`

The first ZIP file (pics.zip) contains all the images in JPG format in the `pics/` folder. 

The second ZIP file (points.zip) contains POINTS.CUP that cointains the waypoints with filenames of pictures corresponding to points in the `pics` column of the CUP file (without folder name).
